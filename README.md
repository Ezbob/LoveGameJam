Coding by Tiggles, sprites by Ezbob

### How to run it

Init git submodules and then zip it all into a '.love' archive to run it with löve.

The \*NIX scripts, 'init' and 'packit' does the submodule init and packing (output file called 'game.love') for you if you're on an \*NIX machine with zip and git installed.
