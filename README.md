### How to run it

#### Shipping it
Init git submodules and then zip it all into a '.love' archive to run it with löve.

The \*NIX scripts, 'init' and 'packit' does the submodule init and packing (output file called 'game.love') for you if you're on an \*NIX machine with zip and git installed.

#### No shipping

Have Löve2d installed and use the following CLI command in the top-level directory(e.g. where the 'main.lua' file is):
```
love .
```
